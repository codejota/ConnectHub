 # What is ConnectHub?


ConnectHub is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developed as part of my studies on LocalStorage and API consumption. It features a set of default bookmarks that can be customized through the code, and each bookmark is presented in a card with its logo and name.

The application also includes a search field that redirects to Google, as well as a side-menu with more links. At the bottom of the page, users can find real-time quotes for several currencies, such as USD, BRL, EUR, and more.

One of the most exciting features of ConnectHub is that users can add their own bookmarks/favorites by providing the name and link, which will be saved to the LocalStorage for future use. With ConnectHub, managing bookmarks and staying up-to-date with currency quotes is easy and convenient!

## Final Thoughts

First off, I wanna give a shout-out to everyone who helped make this project happen. ConnectHub taught me a ton about LocalStorage and API consumption, and I had a blast building it. There were definitely some bumps in the road, but with the help of my fellow devs, we were able to push through.

Looking ahead, I'm excited to add support for more currencies and maybe even a dark mode for all you night owls out there. If you've got any other suggestions for features or improvements, hit me up!

All in all, this has been an awesome journey, and I'm grateful for all the lessons I've learned along the way. Thanks again to everyone who made it possible, and let's keep pushing the limits of what we can achieve!
