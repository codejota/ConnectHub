 # What is ConnectHub?


ConnectHub is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developed as part of my studies on LocalStorage and API consumption. It features a set of default bookmarks that can be customized through the code, and each bookmark is presented in a card with its logo and name.

The application also includes a search field that redirects to Google, as well as a side-menu with more links. At the bottom of the page, users can find real-time quotes for several currencies, such as USD, BRL, EUR, and more.

One of the most exciting features of ConnectHub is that users can add their own bookmarks/favorites by providing the name and link, which will be saved to the LocalStorage for future use. With ConnectHub, managing bookmarks and staying up-to-date with currency quotes is easy and convenient!
